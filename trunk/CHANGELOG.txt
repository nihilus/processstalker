    - gml.py: Fixed bug in parsing of GDE saved GML files.
    - gml.py: Per node register listings are now sorted in alphabetical order.
    - ps_state_mapper.py: Fixed bug in handling of filename arguments containing directory modifiers. ex: './seh.gml' and '../seh.gml'.
    - process_stalker.exe: Replaced reliance on DebugActiveProcessStop() and DebugSetProcessKillOnExit() function resolution with dynamic function loading. This was preventing the tracer from running on systems that don't support the API such as Windows 2000.
